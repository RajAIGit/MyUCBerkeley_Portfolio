# Used Car Price Analysis

## Problem Statement
The provided dataset contains information on 426K cars. Your goal is to understand what factors make a car more or less expensive. As a result of your analysis, you should provide clear recommendations to your client -- a used car dealership -- as to what consumers value in a used car.

## Approach
1. Load and clean the dataset.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand price distribution and key trends.
3. Use machine learning (Random Forest) to identify feature importance.
4. Provide actionable recommendations based on findings.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python 3 and Jupyter Notebook installed.
2. Install required libraries: pandas, numpy, plotly, scikit-learn.
3. Open `used_car_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook and run all cells.

## Deliverables
- Jupyter Notebook: `used_car_analysis.ipynb`
- README file: `README.md`
